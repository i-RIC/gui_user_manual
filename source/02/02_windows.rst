Windows
========

:numref:`image_iric_main_window` shows the iRIC main window.

It uses a standard interface, with a menu bar and a toolbar. Menu bar
and tool bar are explained in :ref:`sec_menubar_and_toolbar`.

When using iRIC, you can open various subwindows that meet your needs
inside the main window. The [Pre-processing Window] opens as soon as you
make a new project.

Subwindows are explained in :ref:`sec_pre_window` to
:ref:`sec_scattered_graph_window`.

A [Pre-processing Window] opens when a project starts. Other subwindows
are not opened at first. You can open them manually when you need to.
