Editing the grid
===================

The following is an explanation of the grid creating functions.

When the Pre-processor is active, grids can be created by using the menu
in [Grid] (G). The following manipulations are possible:
-  [Edit]
-  [Delete]

[Edit] has the following three functions:

-  Edits the node coordinates
-  Edits the node attributes
-  Edits the cell attributes

These editing manipulations are carried out as follows:

1. In [Object Browser], select [Grid].
2. Select the node you want to edit.
3. Edit the coordinates or attributes of the selected node.

Regarding 1. and 3., refer to :ref:`sec_grid_edit_node_coordinates`
to :ref:`sec_grid_edit_cell_atts`. Regarding
2., the operation is common, so refer to :ref:`sec_grid_edit_select_node`.

Regarding the import and export of a grid, refer to :ref:`sec_file_import_grid`
and :ref:`sec_file_export_grid` respectively.
