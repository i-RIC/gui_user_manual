Selecting an object in a canvas
-------------------------------

Select an object (i.e., a river transverse line or nodes of the grid
that is displayed in the canvas) as follows:

-  Left click: Selects the object that is pointed at.
-  Left drag: Selects all objects in the rectangle made by the drag
   start and finish points.

Note that not all type objects support multiple selecting by left
dragging. For details, refer to the description of each function.
