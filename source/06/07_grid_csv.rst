iRIC grid CSV file (\*.csv)
============================

The iRIC grid CSV file (\*.csv) is a text file that stores grid shapes and grid attributes of
single-block BFC grid.

In columns with header X, Y, and Z grid node coordinates are stored.
In the following columnd, grid attributes values are stored. In the header row, 
Grid attribute names are stored with prefix "N\_" (in case of attribute defined at nodes)
or "C\_" (in case of attribute defined at cells).

For attributes defined at cells, value 0 is stored at rows for I = IMax and J = Jmax, as dummy data.

:numref:`iric_grid_example` shows an example of iRIC grid CSV file.
