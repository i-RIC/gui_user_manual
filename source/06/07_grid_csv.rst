iRIC 格子CSVファイル (\*.csv)
================================

iRIC 格子CSVファイル（\*.csv）は、シングルブロックのBFC格子の構造と
格子点の属性、セルの属性を保存するテキストファイルです。

X, Y, Z には格子の頂点の座標が格納されます。
その後の列には、格子の属性の値が格納されます。属性名の先頭に、 "N\_" (格子点属性の場合), "C\_" (セル属性の場合) の
いずれかが付加されます。

セル属性の場合、Iが最大の行、Jが最大の行には、必ずダミー値として 0 が格納されます。

iRIC 格子CSVファイルの例を :numref:`iric_grid_example` に示します。
