DEM data file (\*.txt)
========================

A DEM data file (\*txt.) is a type of file for saving the x-, y- and z-
coordinate values of a point.

It can be used as a file type for importing elevation data for iRIC.

A DEM data file is a CSV-delimited text file. It gives one height datum
to one plane coordinates (x, y). Each column has the following meaning:

-  Index of the coordinates (iRIC skips it)
-  x-coordinate
-  y-coordinate
-  z-coordinate (elevation)
