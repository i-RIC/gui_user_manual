RiTER3D project file (\*.ertr)
===============================================

RiTER3D project files are project files for the RiTER3D terrain editing software. iRIC can import edited terrain data as a TIN from a RiTER3D project file.

After importing a RiTER3D project file, with iRIC running
when you edit the terrain in RiTER3D and overwrite the project file, iRIC will detect the change and re-import the TIN from the new project file. This allows for smooth data integration between RiTER3D and iRIC.
