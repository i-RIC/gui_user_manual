Introduction
============

The International River Interface Cooperative (iRIC) software
application provides an integrated river simulation environment.

iRIC provides a comprehensive, unified environment in which data that
are necessary for river analysis solvers (hereafter: solvers) can be
compiled, rivers can be simulated and analytical results can be
visualized.

The highly flexible iRIC interface allows various solvers to be
imported, or you can use one of the iRIC solvers. Upon selecting the
solver, iRIC selects functions suitable for the solver and prepares the
optimal simulation environment.

Because the iRIC functions vary depending on the solver, the method of
using the iRIC application depends on the solver. To determine which
functions are usable for each solver, refer to Solver Tutorials.

This user\'s manual explains general methods for using all the iRIC
functions.
